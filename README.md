# Airbnb
I had the opportunity to analyze Airbnb data together with Heleen, Febe and Evelyne. The project was in the scope of the Analytical Customer Relationship Management course (aCRM) at Ghent University. The data was retrieved from Kaggle and contained a variety of information about Airbnb listings in New York. 

My main contributions to the group work were a Neural Network to predict the average listing price for the next year, a Random Forest that classifies prices in order to make price recommendations to Airbnb hosts and finally a linear regression  model to identify the factors that influence an Airbnb listing.
